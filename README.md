## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevant to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevant to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Adaptability
During the pandemic, I started an Instagram page dedicated to discussing personal finances and conducted small consulting meetings and group discussions. This experience was fundamental in honing my ability to translate customer needs into effective financial plans.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill


## Education

#### Centro Universitário Curitiba (Aug 2011 – Jun 2015)

- International Relations Bachelor’s Degree
  

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

Any cool stuff that makes you a super part of a software development team
